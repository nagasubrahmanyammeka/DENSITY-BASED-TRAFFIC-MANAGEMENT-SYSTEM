DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

 In this project "Design Thinking in traffic management system" is helps to clear the traffic based on the traffic intensity it help to reduce the time to  wait in the long traffic . In this project if suppose one road traffic is clearing after that the signal is pass to high traffic road to clear the traffic in high traffic roads orderly based on the traffic intensity in  roads.

Advantages:-
•	It can be used to reduce the traffic problems.
•	It is useful police department to handle without usage of more number of officers.
•	It can reduce accidents during traffic clearence time.
•	It can be reduce the time to wait in traffic.

Working:-

•	Step-1:Reading the traffic roads

•	Step-2-Finding the in which road traffic is high

•	Step-3 :-Giving signal in clockwise manner.

•	Step-4 :- Signaling is automatically release time increased to the high traffic road.

•	Step-5 :- Observing the insights of customer by asking, the why , what, when questions.

•	Step-6 :- It will help to give some information about traffic.

•	Step-7 :- Making some modifications if required. 

•	Step-8 :- Based on traffic signaling it is passed the traffic police can also help to clearence.

•	Step-9 :- After it releasing the traffic more effectively.

Components Required :-

 1. Arduino UNO.

 2. Jumper Wires.

 3. IR sensors

 4. Gas Sensor.

 5. LCD Display

 6. LED's.
